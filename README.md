# ea-scripts

TypeScript workspace for building and maintaining multiple ExcalidrawAutomate scripts in one repository. This repository was created from `ea-script-template`.

## Template or Fork?

Use this repository as a template when:

- you want one workspace containing many scripts
- you want shared lint/build/tooling and shared utilities
- you are building script PRs for obsidian-excalidraw-plugin

Fork this repository when:

- you want to publish your own long-lived script workspace publicly
- you need to customize lint/build/release policy while retaining this baseline

Create one repo per script only when strict isolation is required.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsviczian/ea-script-template.git my-ea-scripts
cd my-ea-scripts
npm install
npm run build
```

Build output lands in a shared folder with one subfolder per script:

```text
build/{script-slug}/{script-slug}.md
build/{script-slug}/{script-slug}.svg
```

Script extension semantics in Obsidian Excalidraw (since plugin 2.27.0):

- both `.js` and `.md` script files are supported
- if both extensions exist for the same script name, `.md` takes precedence
- this template emits `.md` so scripts remain easy to view and edit in Obsidian's markdown editor

Generated scripts start with the script's local `README.md` and a UTC build timestamp, followed by editable top-level `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` configuration constants and then the bundled script. If a script has no `README.md`, the documentation section is left empty.

## Included scripts

- `slideshow`: the production Slideshow script, organized as typed path,
  controls, lifecycle, and PDF modules

## Testing convention

Tests are co-located with the code they own:

- script tests: `src/scripts/{slug}/__tests__/*.test.ts`
- shared utility tests: `src/sharedUtils/__tests__/*.test.ts`

This keeps each script portable as the repository grows and avoids maintaining a
second, mirrored directory tree. Keep `main.ts` as the executable bootstrap and
put behavior in import-safe modules; tests must not import `main.ts`, because it
runs immediately against Obsidian globals. Vitest discovers all suites through
one root configuration, and `npm run check` is the universal repository gate.

## Localization convention

Every script owns its strings under `src/scripts/{slug}/lang/`. `en.ts` is the
typed source of truth; `de.ts`, `es.ts`, `fr.ts`, `ru.ts`, and `zh-cn.ts` contain
language-specific catalogs. Lookup tries the exact locale, its base language,
then English. Use named placeholders for dynamic values and obtain the runtime
locale with `ea.obsidian.moment.locale()`.

## Excalidraw Automate API conventions

- Use `verifyMinimumPluginVersion()` for plugin requirements and
  `verifyMinAppVersion()` only for Obsidian application requirements.
- Use `ea.setView()` for automatic view selection, `ea.setView(view)` for an
  explicit binding, and `ea.setView(null)` to represent an unbound sidepanel.
- Branch on `utils.executionSource` when autostart/restore executions should
  only register lifecycle behavior while manual invocation performs the action.
- Use `ea.registerAutostart(message)` to explain what autostart registers. The
  message appears between the permission question and permission-management hint.
- Element-action providers receive an icon name; custom DOM buttons should use
  `ea.obsidian.getIcon()`.
- Prefer awaited EA mutation/save operations over direct unpublished view APIs.

## Publishing model

This template supports multiple scripts in one workspace, but publication is still script-by-script.

For each script PR to obsidian-excalidraw-plugin:

- copy `build/{slug}/{slug}.md` into `ea-scripts/{Script Name}.md`
- copy or export preview image using `scripts-{slug}.{ext}` naming
- update `ea-scripts/index-new.md` manually
- update `ea-scripts/directory-info.json` including `mtime` for updates

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for full details.

## Agent auto-discovery

This repository includes agent guidance surfaces:

- [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for cross-agent behavior and workflow constraints
- [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for implementation architecture notes
- [.ai/excalidraw-automate/SKILL.md](./.ai/excalidraw-automate/SKILL.md) plus local references and script examples synchronized from plugin outputs

## Development dependencies

The template includes dev dependencies for:

- Obsidian typings/runtime interfaces via `obsidian`
- Excalidraw type surface via `@zsviczian/excalidraw`
- Direct plugin repository access via `obsidian-excalidraw-plugin` Git dependency for reference workflows

These are for authoring and type/reference workflows, not runtime script execution inside Obsidian.
