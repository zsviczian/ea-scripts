# ea-scripts

TypeScript workspace for building and maintaining multiple ExcalidrawAutomate scripts in one repository. This repository is a fork of `ea-script-template` containing the maintained ExcalidrawAutomate scripts published by this author.

## Fork and Keep in Sync

Keep this fork updated with changes from the `ea-script-template` master
repository so it receives API, tooling, and documentation updates.

Keep the shared agent and authoring files aligned with the master repository:

- `AGENTS.md` is the main guide for agents working in the repository.
- `CLAUDE.md` points to `AGENTS.md` for tools that discover it.
- Put rules specific to this fork in `FORK_RULES.md` rather than modifying
  `AGENTS.md`, `AUTHORING_GUIDE.md`, or `CLAUDE.md`.

This repository is not the publishing target for scripts. Do not open pull
requests to `ea-script-template` or `ea-scripts` to publish a script. Publish
scripts separately in the `obsidian-excalidraw-plugin` repository as described
in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Using this repository as a GitHub template

You can also use the GitHub **Use this template** action to create your own
repository. A template-created repository is not automatically connected to
this repository, but it can still receive future updates by adding the
template as an `upstream` remote:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/zsviczian/ea-script-template.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

Use the template repository's default branch if it is not `main`. If the
template-created repository has unrelated Git history, the first merge may
need:

```bash
git merge upstream/main --allow-unrelated-histories
```

Resolve any conflicts once, then continue syncing with `git fetch upstream`
and `git merge upstream/main`. Whether you fork this repository or create a
repository from its template, keep fork-specific rules in `FORK_RULES.md` and
keep shared guidance aligned with the template.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsviczian/ea-scripts.git
cd ea-scripts
npm install
npm run build
```

Build output lands in a shared folder with one subfolder per script:

```text
build/{script-slug}/{script-slug}.md
build/{script-slug}/{script-slug}.svg
```

Script extension semantics in Obsidian Excalidraw (since plugin 2.27.0):

- both `.js` and `.md` script files are supported
- if both extensions exist for the same script name, `.md` takes precedence
- this template emits `.md` so scripts remain easy to view and edit in Obsidian's markdown editor

Generated scripts start with the script's local `README.md` and a UTC build timestamp, followed by editable top-level `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` configuration constants and then the bundled script. If a script has no `README.md`, the documentation section is left empty.

## Included scripts

- `slideshow`: the production Slideshow script, organized as typed path,
  controls, lifecycle, and PDF modules

## Testing convention

Tests are co-located with the code they own:

- script tests: `src/scripts/{slug}/__tests__/*.test.ts`
- shared utility tests: `src/sharedUtils/__tests__/*.test.ts`

This keeps each script portable as the repository grows and avoids maintaining a
second, mirrored directory tree. Keep `main.ts` as the executable bootstrap and
put behavior in import-safe modules; tests must not import `main.ts`, because it
runs immediately against Obsidian globals. Vitest discovers all suites through
one root configuration, and `npm run check` is the universal repository gate.

Reusable performance infrastructure belongs in `src/sharedUtils`: use
`AsyncTaskQueue` to serialize expensive rendering and invalidate stale queued
work, and `ByteBudgetLruCache` when cached values have materially different
memory costs. Keep scene selection, cache keys, and DOM visibility policy in
the owning script.

## Localization convention

Every script owns its strings under `src/scripts/{slug}/lang/`. `en.ts` is the
typed source of truth; `de.ts`, `es.ts`, `fr.ts`, `ru.ts`, and `zh-cn.ts` contain
language-specific catalogs. Lookup tries the exact locale, its base language,
then English. Use named placeholders for dynamic values and obtain the runtime
locale with `ea.obsidian.moment.locale()`.

## Excalidraw Automate API conventions

- Use `verifyMinimumPluginVersion()` for plugin requirements and
  `verifyMinimumPluginVersion()` only for Obsidian application requirements.
- Use `ea.setView()` for automatic view selection, `ea.setView(view)` for an
  explicit binding, and `ea.setView(null)` to represent an unbound sidepanel.
- Branch on `utils.executionSource` when automatic executions should only
  register lifecycle behavior while manual invocation performs the action.
  The trigger values are `manual`, `plugin-startup`, `view-autostart`,
  `sidepanel-restore`, `sidepanel-reload`, and `drawing-onload`.
- Use `ea.registerAutostart(message)` to explain what autostart registers. The
  message appears between the permission question and permission-management hint.
- Use `ea.registerCleanup(cleanup)` for external listeners, timers, observers,
  and subscriptions. The callback runs when the EA instance that registered it
  is destroyed; the returned function unregisters it without running it.
- Element-action providers receive an icon name; custom DOM buttons should use
  `ea.obsidian.getIcon()`.
- Prefer awaited EA mutation/save operations over direct unpublished view APIs.

## Publishing model

This fork supports multiple scripts in one workspace, but publication is still script-by-script.

For each script PR to `obsidian-excalidraw-plugin`:

- copy `build/{slug}/{slug}.md` into `ea-scripts/{Script Name}.md`
- copy or export preview image using `scripts-{slug}.{ext}` naming
- update `ea-scripts/index-new.md` manually
- update `ea-scripts/directory-info.json` including `mtime` for updates

Do not open this PR against `ea-scripts` or `ea-script-template`; the script
publication PR belongs in the separate plugin repository. See
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for full details.

## Agent auto-discovery

This repository includes agent guidance surfaces:

- [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for the canonical agent behavior, architecture, and workflow guidance
- [FORK_RULES.md](./FORK_RULES.md) for rules specific to this fork
- [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) as a compatibility pointer to `AGENTS.md`
- [.ai/excalidraw-automate/SKILL.md](./.ai/excalidraw-automate/SKILL.md) plus local references and script examples synchronized from plugin outputs

## Development dependencies

The template includes dev dependencies for:

- Obsidian typings/runtime interfaces via `obsidian`
- Excalidraw type surface via `@zsviczian/excalidraw`
- Direct plugin repository access via `obsidian-excalidraw-plugin` Git dependency for reference workflows

These are for authoring and type/reference workflows, not runtime script execution inside Obsidian.
